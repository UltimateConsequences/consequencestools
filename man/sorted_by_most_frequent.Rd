\title{Sort variable description by frequency}
\usage{
sorted_by_most_frequent(var_description, def, grouping_var = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{var_description}{A list containing variable metadata with elements:
\itemize{
  \item \code{r_variable}: Name of the variable in the dataframe
  \item \code{levels}: Character vector of level names
  \item \code{colors}: Named vector of colors for each level
  \item \code{levels_es}: (Optional) Spanish translations of levels
  \item \code{colors_es}: (Optional) Spanish-named color vector
}}

\item{def}{The dataframe containing the data to analyze}

\item{grouping_var}{Optional grouping variable (not used, included for
consistency with \code{sorted_by_widest_appearance})}
}
\value{
A modified variable description list with levels and colors reordered
  by frequency. Includes a new \code{$ranked} element with the sorted levels.
}
\description{
Reorders the levels and colors in a variable description list based on
the frequency of each level in the data. More frequent levels are ranked
higher.

\dontrun{
deaths <- assign_protest_domain_levels(deaths_aug24)
# Sort protest domains by total frequency
pd_sorted <- sorted_by_most_frequent(
  var_description = lev$protest_domain,
  def = deaths
