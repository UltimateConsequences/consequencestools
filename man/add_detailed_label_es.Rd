\title{Add Detailed Label in Spanish to Dataframe}
\usage{
add_detailed_label_es(dataframe)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataframe}{A dataframe containing event and deceased person information}
}
\value{
A dataframe with an added 'detailed_label' column
}
\description{
Add Detailed Label in Spanish to Dataframe
}
\details{
This function creates a detailed HTML-formatted label for each row in the dataframe.
It includes information such as event title, protest domain, deceased person's name,
affiliation, cause of death, incident date, and location (if available).

The function first checks and repairs 'name_line' and 'incident_line' if they're missing.
It then applies color coding to the protest domain and combines all information into
a single detailed label.
}
\note{
This function assumes the existence of a 'protest_domain.colors' vector for color coding.
}
